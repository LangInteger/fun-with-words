Hello, I'm Lang, welcome to fun with words, today I'm going to introduce the word congenial to you.

congenial 的意思是意气相投的、性格相似的，或者舒适的、适意的。

这个词源自于 ancient Roman and Greek mythology, 传说中每个人生来都被赋予一种 guardian spirit，这种守护元气在拉丁文中被称为 genius。对于相处融洽的两个人，我们可以说他们 sharing a similar spirit。同时，我们可以用代表 together 的拉丁文前缀 com 和代表 guardian spirit 的单词 genius 来描述这种 CP，可以得到

- com-genius

最终在英语中，这个词演化为 congenial。

- I found him very congenial.

代表我和他很合得来。我们也可以把 congenial 的意思延伸至更广泛意义上的舒适和惬意，作为 pleasant 的同义词，这种含义的用法在当下甚至更加普遍，比如：

- But what Uncle Dai's lacks in accouterments, it more than makes up for in the congeniality of its service. -- DINING OUT; A Congenial Chinese Newcomer -- New York Times August 13, 1989, Page CN12
- 意思是，戴叔叔这家馆子虽然硬件不咋地，但是贴心舒适的服务完全弥补了这些不足

congenial 还有一些其他意思，比如可以指天生的，在这种情况下，其含义同 congenital。从使用趋势来看，congenial 大部分情况下代表舒适的，有时被用于代表合得来的，很少被用于代表天生的。

- 舒适的 > 合得来的 >> 天生的

要掌握这个单词呢并不是很难，我们可以用一首打油诗来记忆

你是我的congenial
两个同学一道走，互诉衷肠congenial
秉烛夜谈志趣投，一生友来一回眸
惬意时光惬意游，此情此景congenial
月影阑珊烛光柔，世间再无那闲愁

CHINESE restaurants have traditionally offered good value for families dining out. Even today, when restaurant prices are steadily rising, this continues to be true, as Uncle Dai's, a new Chinese restaurant in downtown Stamford, demonstrates. Uncle Dai's does not put a lot of emphasis on decor. A few pictures, a lacquered screen masking flowers do their bit to dress up a long, drag storefront with red plastic chairs and booths and matching carpet. But what Uncle Dai's lacks in accouterments, it more than makes up for in the congeniality of its service. The menu is described as Sichuan-Hunan, but if you prefer really incendiary food, you will have to request it with insistence. The red-starred ''hot and spicy'' dishes are pleasantly seasoned, but in no way fiery. True to the form of so many other Chinese restaurants in Connecticut, Uncle Dai's breaks no new culinary ground. But within the framework of the all-too-familiar menu, it does a serviceable job of preparing and serving many standbys. It does add one welcome touch, illustrating its willingness to please its customers: it brings dishes in sequence, rather than serving all the appetizers, and then all the entrees at one time. We had requested sequencing the courses Chinese style so that dishes (which all the diners wanted to share) could be savored and enjoyed one or two at a time, without getting cold. Lo and behold! Uncle Dai's complied with our request, a signal that an effort it being made to please the diner, and not simply cater to the convenience of the staff. There is a long list of chef's specialties, similar to other chefs's specialties to be sure, but after trying many of them and other dishes on the regular menu, we would advise following the chef's lead. Surprisingly, they are the same price of just one or two dollars more expensive than the regular entrees. The clear winner among the entrees was dried sauteed beef Sichuan style, which had excellent flavor, and the spicy meat strips played off well against the shredded carrots. Capital chicken, tender white meat pieces with shiitake mushrooms and broccoli, needed more seasoning and additional vegetable textures to overcome its blandness even the crunchy sour taste of its watercress bed was not sufficient help. The seasoning was perfect in the sesame chicken, though - a pleasantly spiced medley of chicken chunks rolled in sesame seeds and served with al dente broccoli. Crispy prawns (jumbo shrimp) with caramelized walnuts were prepared with a light touch, as was a generous portion of sliced duck with scallions in a brown sauce. Tasty appetizers included lively seasoned Sichuan dumplings in red hot oil with a minced port filling, and well-prepared dim sum (tiny steamed dumplings filled primarily with chopped shrimp and water chestnuts). Warm noodles with sesame and hot sauce were also competently prepared. The only serious misstep was an order of scallion pancakes that tasted deep-fried to a tough, tasteless crisp. Tofu Sichuan style with minced pork, deceptively red-starred for hot and spicy, proved innocuously free of spice or flavor and was formless as well. Desserts are mnimal at Uncle Dai's - lichee, pineapple and ice cream. The fragrant pistachio ice cream was studded with pistachios and very tasty. Four appetizers and four entrees came to $54.60, with items left on the platter for the doggy bag. The tax and tip were extra. It is possible to eat for even less, as many entrees run between $6.95 to $8.95. A glass of white wine is offered without charge, as Uncle Dai's does not have a liquor license. While there is nothing exceptional about Uncle Dai's, it serves acceptable Chinese fare at prices that make it possible to feed the family and even assorted guests for modest cost. A few extras - caramelized walnuts served gratis when you arrive and fresh orange wedges and pineapple chunks accompanying forturn cookies at the meal's end - add to the sense of welcome that Uncle Dai's extends.
